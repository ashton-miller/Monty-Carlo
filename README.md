# Monty-Carlo
A python based Monte Carlo simulation for stock prices, to predict probability of taking profit at different levels.


I wrote the starter code for this project when trying to mimic the Tastyworks 50% probability of profit feature. This will allow the percentage of profit to be chosen and probabilities to be predicted.


If you are reading this current README, then you should know that the code is still heavily under development. 
The main file to do the simulation is monte_bs.py; soon the other files in the repo will be deleted and this one will be left. Please get in contact with me if you have any questions!


Upcoming Progress:

	1.) Update all of the monte_bs.py to comply with pep8.
	
	2.) Change to an object based method.
	
	3.) Work on making implimentation easier so a user can just call the python functions
