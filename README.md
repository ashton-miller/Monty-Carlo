# Monty-Carlo
A python based Monte Carlo simulation for stock prices, to predict probability of taking profit at different levels.


I wrote the starter code for this project when trying to mimic the Tastyworks 50% probability of profit feature. This will allow the percentage of profit to be chosen and probabilities to be predicted.
